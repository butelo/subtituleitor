subtituleitor
=============

Automatic subtitler made in python PySide.


I pretend to make a tool that takes care of this steps:

1. Drag the video inside the gui (drag'n drop)
2. Get the name of the video and search subtitles online
3. Let the user choose from all the options wich one suits better
3. Download the subtitle
4. Place it in the same folder than the video
5. Rename subtitle file to match video file name



It will be made in python/PySide and will be multiplatform (linux, osx, windows)

This tool is for my own use but if it works right could be public released. Anyway you can always download the code from here and use it for anything you want.
